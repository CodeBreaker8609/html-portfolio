<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 29 years old and I currently live in Florida. I've always desired to be in a career
  that leverages my creative talents and the technical skills that I have been learning over the
  years. My main goal is to become a Front-End Web Developer before the end of 2023.
</p>

<p>I'm an avid reader of sci-fi novels and I love PC and console gaming. I have been an active
  gamer since the age of 5 years old beginning with the Sega Genesis console.
</p>

<p>I have always wanted to have a career that melds well with my love of technology and design since the age
  of 5 years old. As a child, I thought that my career path should be in Animation. As an adult,
  I grew an interest in programming and web development. I found that a career in Web Development
  could help me to combine creativity, an interest in animation, and a newfound desire to program
  new applications and websites.
